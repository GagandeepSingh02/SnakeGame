Hello connections
This is my submission for Hackathon2 at pepcoding.
I have made this classic and nostalgic snake game. Challenge yourself and make your snake grow as much as you can 
by not colliding it to itself or the walls (and if you think it's easy you can increase or decrease the speed of the snake
as per your choice and then try your luck).

You can compete with yourself to be a high scorer as it stores all your previous high scores.

I have tried to make it interactive by adding different sounds on each sort of moves so you do not miss out an atmost 
experience of playing.
I would like to thank bhavesh bansal sir and sumit malik sir for providing this oppourtunity.
